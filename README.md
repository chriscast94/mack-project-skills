# mack-project-skills

## Description
The goal of the site was to create a place where people can learn any new skill whenever they want, hassle free, right at the push of a button.

Who is the Audience?
-People who were bored
-People wanting to learn something new
People who had an idea of what they wanted to learn, but didn't know where to start

We titled the site "Today I Learned..." as a way to hone in on the what you wanted to learn that day.
Using various API's, we will generate (both randomly and not), a resource where the user can learn a new skill, anuything from baking a cake, to parkour.
We kept the layout of the site simple to prevent any distractions from the product; we wanted to make sure that the skills were what was being presented.

Based off your interest for the day (or randomly), we will generate a video where you can learn a new skill. If you want to learn how to make cocktails, a recipe/video of a new cocktail will show up. If you want to learn how to write a poem, a video/guide will generate.
