## Description
The goal is to create a site where people can learn any new skill whenever they want, right at the push of a button.

Who is the Audience?
- People looking to learn new things
- People who are bored
- People who are looking to make themselves seem more interesting

What is the problem we are addressing?
In a digital sea, where everything is available all the time, it's hard to figure out exactly what you want to learn. We're making it easy.
If you want to learn something new, we got you covered.

How does the product solve the problem?
Using various API's, we will generate (both randomly and not), a resource where the user can learn a new skill, anuything from baking a cake, to parkour.

Project Title: "Today I Learned..."
Description: Based off your interest for the day (or randomly), we will generate a video where you can learn a new skill. If you want to learn how to make cocktails, a recipe/video of a new cocktail will show up. If you want to learn how to write a poem, a video/guide will generate. 
User Story: Michael and Kenny are looking to improve themselves daily by learning some new skill/ability, but don't know where or how to start. So, they go to "Today I learned..." and click on the randomization button to randomly generate a new skill learning video/document. Today, a video from YouTube was generated that shows them how to make flower tomatoes. They're great as adecorations of a meal they prepared (and learned how to make the previous day).
